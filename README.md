# Document Classification and Extraction API

This project provides an API to classify documents (such as invoices) and extract important fields like invoice number, date, amount, and vendor. It uses machine learning for document classification and regular expressions to extract specific data from invoices.

## Features
- **Document Classification**: Classify documents into categories like invoice, email, or budget.
- **Invoice Extraction**: If the document is classified as an invoice, key information (invoice number, date, amount, vendor) is extracted.
- **Supports PDF and Image Files**: Extract text from both PDFs and image files using OCR.
